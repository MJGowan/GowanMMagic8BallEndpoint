Magic 8 Ball - Endpoint
This program should generate a random statement that can answer a question from the user.

Peer review: Jasmine Leek - code works great, the cheat sheet in the notes is such a smart/helpful choice for the user, funny messages too. Nice work!

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/Magic/Ask
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you will have /Magic/Ask. Think of a yes or no question, press "Send", and voila! The non-spherical "ball" will provide an answer.
